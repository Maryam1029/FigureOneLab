Short summary: This study looks at the gene expression patterns of kidney tumors in both children and adults. By comparing these tumors to normal kidney cells, the researchers identified differences in their cellular behavior, revealing that childhood kidney cancers often resemble early, fetal-like states, while most adult tumors do not show a similar "reversion" to this state. The team also discovered that these tumors have connections to specific types of kidney cells that develop during early life, providing new insights into the origins and growth of kidney cancers. These findings could improve how kidney tumors are diagnosed and treated.
